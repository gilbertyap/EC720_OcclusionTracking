# EC720_OcclusionTracking

## Object Tracking Under Occlusion Scenarios

This is the repository for Gilbert Yap's Boston Univeristy EC720 "Digital Video Processing" final project.

### Requirements

* Uses [YOLOv4](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) for object detection.
* * These files can be directly placed into the YOLO v4 folder once `make` has been run. 
* TODO - Will use [Deep SORT](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort) as a benchmark tool
* For python requirements, use `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Even better, open up a virtual environment and install the requirements there.
